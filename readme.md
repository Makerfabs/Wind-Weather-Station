# Wind Weather Station

## Intruduce

Weather station based on Maduino A9G.With onboard DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, BMP280 air pressure sensor and SSD1306LCD screen.It can be connected with anemometer and PM2.5 air quality sensor.

## Feature

- Micro controller ATSAMD21G18, 32-Bit ARM Cortex M0+
- PM2.5 monitoring with expanded PM2.5 sensor
- GPS for locating
- Grove connectors for customersâ€™ expanded testing
- OLED display for real-time checking& debugging
- Onboard buzzer/ SD card slot
- High-power 1000 mAH battery for long-term usage
- Solar panel charging
- With Case(but not water-proof), could be re-made for water-proof with glues easily
- Arduino compatible/ Support MQTT

# Example

## Compiler Options

![complier](md_pic/complier.jpg)

Choice Arduino Zero (Native USB Port).

## weather_show_default

Factory default program, collect temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, PM2.5 index, the sensor data display on SSD1306.

- Connect anemometer or air quality sensor (or both) to weather station.
- Connect to battery or USB cable.
- LCD screen will show sensor value.

## at_demo

A simple AT directive demo is provided.

## weather_MQTT

A simple example of MQTT communication. Data is sent by MQTT protocol through A9G module. Need a SIM card that can be connected to the Internet.

## low_power

A simple low-power test program that turns off power to the A9G and all sensors and puts the SAMD21 to sleep.
