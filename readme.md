## Intruduce

### Product Link: [Open Wind Station GPRS/ MQTT](https://www.makerfabs.com/open-wind-statation-gprs-mqtt.html)

### Wiki Link:[Wind_Weather_Station](https://www.makerfabs.com/wiki/index.php?title=Wind_Weather_Station)

Weather station based on Maduino A9G.With onboard DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, BMP280 air pressure sensor and SSD1306LCD screen.It can be connected with anemometer and PM2.5 air quality sensor.

## Feature

- Micro controller ATSAMD21G18, 32-Bit ARM Cortex M0+
- PM2.5 monitoring with expanded PM2.5 sensor
- GPS for locating
- Grove connectors for customersâ€™ expanded testing
- OLED display for real-time checking& debugging
- Onboard buzzer/ SD card slot
- High-power 1000 mAH battery for long-term usage
- Solar panel charging
- With Case(but not water-proof), could be re-made for water-proof with glues easily
- Arduino compatible/ Support MQTT

# Example

## Compiler Options

![complier](md_pic/complier.jpg)

Choice Arduino Zero (Native USB Port).

## weather_show_default

Factory default program, collect temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, PM2.5 index, the sensor data display on SSD1306.

- Connect anemometer or air quality sensor (or both) to weather station.
- Connect to battery or USB cable.
- LCD screen will show sensor value.

## at_demo

A simple AT directive demo is provided.

## weather_MQTT

A simple example of MQTT communication. Data is sent by MQTT protocol through A9G module. Need a SIM card that can be connected to the Internet.

## low_power

A simple low-power test program that turns off power to the A9G and all sensors and puts the SAMD21 to sleep.



# Project : Weather Station

**A long-maintained weather station project, real-time weather from Makerfabs can be accessed via ThingSpeak and Makerfabs Wiki (Shenzhen, China).**

![weather_station](md_pic/weahter_station1.jpg)

The weather link is as follows:

[Makerfabs Wiki Weather](https://www.makerfabs.com/wiki/index.php?title=Weather_Show)

[ThingSpeak Show](https://thingspeak.com/channels/1243124)

[HackDay.io wind weather station](https://hackaday.io/project/177972-wind-weather-station)

## Code

The code is divided into two parts, one is the Weather Station, which measures the weather data and sends it to ThingSpeak and MQTT servers.

And there is a use of ESP32 as a terminal to receive real-time information code.

## Weather Analysis

The test lasted for ten days in June, and the analysis data are as follows.

![weather_station](md_pic/weahter_station2.jpg)

And I also make a python file to analyse data, like max or min temperature.

Code is in : \Wind-Weather-Station\Project_WeatherStation\csv_read\csv_test.py

## 3D file

Weather station box and anemometer, wind direction gauge, fixed structure of solar panel.
